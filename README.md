# TeddyCloud

## Features
TeddyCloud is an alternative server for your Toniebox, allowing you to host the could services locally.
This gives you the control about which data is sent to the original manufacturer's cloud and allows you
to host your own figurine audio files on e.g. your NAS or any other server.

Currently implemented are:
* Provide audio content over the air
* Cache original tonie audio content
* Simulate live content (.live)
* Passthrough original tonie audio content
* Basic Web fronted
* Filter custom tags to prevent deletion (.nocloud)
* Configure maximum volume for speaker and headphones
* Configure LED
* Configure slapping
* Customize original box sounds (ex. jingle) over the air

## Planned
* Decode RTNL logs
* MQTT client
* Home Assistant integration (ideas welcome)
* TeddyBench integration
* Web frontend (full stack developers welcome)

## Preparation
### Generate certificates
First of all you'll need to generate the CA and certificates with the starting date 2015-11-03: ```faketime '2015-11-03 00:00:00' gencerts.sh``` Those will be placed in ```/certs/server/```.
This also generates the replacement CA for the toniebox ```certs/server/ca.der```.
If you are using docker, this will happen automatically.

### Dump certificates of your toniebox
You'll need the ```flash:/cert/ca.der``` (Boxine CA), ```flash:/cert/client.der``` (Client Cert) and ```flash:/cert/private.der``` (Client private key). Place those files under ```/certs/*```
#### CC3200
You can use the [cc3200tool](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/cc3200tool) to dump your certificates over the Tag Connect debug port of the box. If you have installed the HackieboxNG Bootloader you should already have those files in your backup.
```
python cc.py -p COM3 read_file /cert/ca.der cert/ca.der read_file /cert/private.der cert/private.der read_file /cert/client.der cert/client.der
```
#### CC3235
You'll have to manually extract it from the flash of the box with a SOP8 clamp directly from the memory or by desoldering it. Reading in-circuit can be tricky, but is possible. 

#### ESP32
You can extract the flash memory either with a SOP8 clamp or via the debug port of the box. 

### Flash the replacement CA
#### CC3200
It is recommended to flash the replacement CA to /cert/c2.der and use the hackiebox-ng bootloader with the altCA patch. This will allow you to switch between the original and your replacement certificate. If you have installed the HackieboxNG Bootloader and the Hackiebox CFW you may upload the certificate via the webinterface of the CFW.
```
python cc.py -p COM3 write_file certs/server/ca.der /cert/c2.der
```
**Beware** The ```blockCheckRemove.310``` patch is breaks the content passthrough to Boxine. Please disable it, if your are using it.

#### CC3235 / ESP32
Replace the original CA within your flash dump with the replacement CA and reflash it to your box.
(no manual or tool available yet)

### DNS
#### CC3200 with altUrl patch
With a CC3200 box it is recommened to use the altUrl patch. Set the DNS entries for ```prod.revvox``` and ```rtnl.revvox``` to the TeddyCloud servers ip-address. 

#### CC3235 / ESP32
Set the DNS entries for ```prod.de.tbs.toys``` and ```rtnl.bxcl.de``` to the TeddyCloud servers ip-address. Beware, this will cut off the connection of all tonieboxes within your network, which arn't patched with your replacement CA!

### Content
Please put your content into the ```/data/content/default/``` in the same structure as on your toniebox. You can place an empty ```500304E0.live``` file beside the content files to mark them as live. With ```500304E0.nocloud``` you can prevent the usage of the Boxine cloud for that tag.

## Docker hints
The docker container automatically generates the server certificates on first run. You can extract the ```certs/server/ca.der``` for your box after that. The container won't run without the ```flash:/cert/ca.der``` (Boxine CA), ```flash:/cert/client.der``` (Client Cert) and ```flash:/cert/private.der``` (Client private key).

An example [docker-compose.yaml can be found within the docker subdir.](docker/docker-compose.yaml)
